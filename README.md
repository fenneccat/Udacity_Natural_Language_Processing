# Udacity_Natural_Language_Processing
Codes learn from Udacity Course (Natural Language Processing)

## Project 1 - POS Tagger
Part of Speech Tagger using Hidden Markov Model.
`pomegranate` is used for build a model.
Simple HMM model with add-one Laplace Smoothing is applied


## Project 2 - IBM Bookworm
By using **IBM Watson's Cloud-based NLP services**, build a simple QA model.
QA model with assistant workspace. By sending a query to system, simple matched answer can be returned.

## Exercise 1 - LDA topic Modeling
* Understand Latent Dirichlet Allocation
* Build LDA model with BOW and TFIDF
* Topic classification

## Exercise 2 - Sentimental Analysis
* Can draw WordCloud with IMDB image

1. classic ML classification models
* Make textdata into vector
* Sentimental analysis with GradientBoostingClassifier, GaussianNB

2. RNN classification model
* use LSTM to build sentimental anaylsis model

3. NN classification model
* Implement NN model from the base
* Parameter adjusting is contained

## Exercise 3 - Keras
* Can build NN models using Keras
	* MLP, RNN (LSTM)
